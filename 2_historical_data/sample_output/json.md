<!-- Sample JSON files generation notes

sample_cases_10days.json and sample_surveys_10days.json can be generated by running the generate_historical_data.py script, then combining or renaming the output JSON lines files accordingly.

Each JSON file is newline-delimited JSON (JSON Lines format), where each line is a complete JSON object. -->
